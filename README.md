# Digital-Camera-Target-Acquisition

MP2 is a Digital Camera Design where we use a FPGA board, c code and a camera hooked up to the board and make a functional camera system. A lot of digital image processing was used here and provided a better look on how cameras and displays work

MP3 builds off MP2 where we hooked up a usb nerf launcher using embedded linux and driver code and built a system where it tracks a target using the camera and fires when it found the middle of it

Glitched screen because the sw version was way slower than the hw version
